# User Authentication

## What is User Authentication

- `User Authentication` is verifying that an appâ€™s users are who they say they are.
- Three Main Authentication Strategy Classes:
    1. `Knowledge` - Verification that the user knows something.
        - Passwords
        - Pins
        - Security Questions
    - Problems include:
        - Reliant on passwords strength.
        - Information can be guessable or searchable.
    1. `Ownership` - Verification that the user has something.
        - Email Address
        - Mobile Phone
        - An OTP fob or app
    - Problems include:
        - When relaying on email, somebody could guess your email password, thus making it knowledge based as well.
        - Physical devices can be stolen.
        - Physical devices can be lost.
    1. `Biological` - Verification based on biological characteristics.
        - Facial Recognition
        - Fingerprint Readers
        - Eye Scans
    - Problems include:
        - Not as common for web based authentication.
        - Having the physical devices stolen can be painful.
- `Two-Factor Authentication` - Combines more than one authentication method, usually knowledge and ownership based.

## Basic Project Setup

- `Project Starting Projects`:

[GitHub - shaunwa/react-auth-starter](https://github.com/shaunwa/react-auth-starter)

- Running is:
    - Front End `npm run start`
    - Back End Node Express Server `npm run dev`
    - MongoDB Mongo Demon `mongod`

## Building a Login Page
